Most importantly, it embraces the theory of building something for the user and with this shows how my background as a landscape architect has so many skills that carry over to digital design. The biggest difference being that this is a phsyical site instead of a digital site.</a>

      <p class="p2 bold fade-in">The park at Metro Water Services (MWS) in Nashville, TN is a user-centered space designed to meet the needs of the local community. It was discovered through comprehensive design research that the community was missing a much-needed park. Fortunately, MWS was committed to addressing this need by incorporating a park into their campus redesign plans. My firm selected me as the primary designer to bring the project to fruition. The park's inclusive design showcases interactive water elements, accessibility features, and sustainable principles that create a memorable user experience for visitors of all ages.</p>

  <!-- Challenges & Goals -->
  <section class="section-container">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p class="p2">Designing an engaging park that met the community's diverse needs was a key challenge for this project. The park had to incorporate a water feature, greenway access, an exercise area, play features for children, and a representation of a rain garden. Furthermore, the site's challenging terrain made it crucial that we think creatively in order to develop a space that was both visually appealing and user-friendly. Ultimately, the team's design strategy aimed to create an inclusive and interactive space that encouraged visitors to explore and interact with all of the park's features.</p>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p class="p2">To address these design challenges, the team adopted a user-centered design approach that incorporated a range of engaging features into the park's design. For example, the park's water features were designed to provide a fun and interactive experience for visitors, while the exercise area was strategically positioned to take advantage of the site's natural contours. The play features for children were designed to promote imagination and exploration while adhering to safety standards. Additionally, the park's design included a representation of a rain garden, which serves as an educational feature while simultaneously serving as a way to mitigate stormwater runoff. By adopting this user-centered approach, the park's design was able to overcome the site's limitations while creating a space that met the community's needs for engagement, education, and recreation.</p>

  <!-- Research -->
  <section class="section-container">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Collecting Community Input</h2>
      <p class="p2">The team conducted design charrettes, which were collaborative brainstorming sessions that brought together stakeholders such as neighborhood members, council people, and experts in landscape architecture. These charrettes helped to identify the park's core features:</p>
      <ul class="p3">
        <li>Interactive water feature: Due to the lack of quality water feature play areas in Nashville, the community expressed a strong need for a water feature park in the area</li>
        <li>Greenway access: The park's location along the Nashville Greenway made it an ideal access point for visitors, and the community expressed a desire for the park to provide a place for residents to engage with the greenway while enjoying park amenities</li>
        <li>Exercise area: The inclusion of an exercise area in the park's design was important to the community, as it provided a space for visitors to engage in physical activity and promote health and wellness</li>
        <li>Add trust signals (client logos, short case blurbs, KPIs) and ensure WCAG compliance</li>
        <li>Play features for children: Providing play features for children was a key aspect of the park's design, as it not only provided a fun and engaging space for children but also helped to create a family-friendly environment that encouraged community interaction and socialization.</li>
      </ul>
      <P>Additionally, community surveys were conducted to obtain feedback on specific park elements, such as the types of water features and equipment that were preferred. The engagement process was essential in ensuring that the park's design was informed by the community's needs and desires, resulting in a space that is both functional and engaging.</P>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Exploratory Research</h2>
      <p class="p2">As the lead designer on this project, I conducted significant research and collaborated with water feature consultants, civil engineers, structural engineers, and outdoor equipment consultants to ensure we were creating a safe and engaging water feature park for our community.</p>
      <p class="p2">During our research and planning phase, we focused on the following key points:</p>
      <ul class="p3">
        <li>Incorporating water feature elements that were both safe and fun for children to play in</li>
        <li>Researching and analyzing other water feature parks to gain inspiration and understanding of successful designs and layouts</li>
        <li>Working with consultants to determine the best materials and equipment to use in the park to ensure durability and longevity</li>
        <li>Designing the park with channels and boulders to create a natural and engaging play environment for children</li>
      </ul>
      <P>In addition, we focused on creating a park that would appeal to a wide range of users. We researched and selected various water feature elements that would provide an exciting and inclusive experience for both children and adults of all ability levels.</P>
      <p>Our team also emphasized the importance of using native and sustainable plantings around the water feature park to promote biodiversity and sustainability in the area. Overall, our goal was to create a safe, engaging, and sustainable water feature park that would provide a unique and enjoyable experience for the community.</p>

      <h2>Schematic Designs and Client Approval</h2>
      <p class="p2">After conducting extensive research and analysis, our team began the exciting process of sketching out ideas for what the water feature park could look like. With all of our notes and insights, we were able to play with many iterations of the design. Through this collaborative process, we landed on a concept that includes a network of concrete channels and stepping stones that are perfect for kids to play on.</p>

        </div> 
        <p class="p2">With approval from MWS, we presented the concept plans to the community. The design team used a combination of schematic drawings and 3D renderings to portray what the park would look like. The 3D renderings helped to give the community a better sense of the scale and detail of the proposed design. During the presentation, the design team emphasized that the drawings were not the final design but rather for discussion and feedback.</p>
        <p2>Families love that:</p>
        <ul class="p3">
          <li>Our park provides a fun and safe environment for kids to play in the water during the hot summer months</li>
          <li>The greenway within the park offers a refreshing space for people to walk, run, and exercise outdoors, which many community members appreciate</li>
          <li>The exercise equipment at the park allows individuals to work out and stay active while enjoying the park's natural setting.</li>

      <h2>Redesigning from opportunity</h2>
      <p class="p2">Once construction on the park began, natural boulders were unearthed during the excavation, prompting a major redesign that involved scrapping the original concrete boulders in favor of using the natural ones. We weren't too hesitant about this plan as it was one of our original concepts but thought purchasing boulders may be too costly. This significant shift required the team to update the drawings and conduct further research on waterproofing. However, in the end, this alteration resulted in a stunning balance between the beauty of nature and the constructed elements of the park.</p>

      <h2>End Result</h2>
      <p class="p2">Designing a community gathering park has taught me the importance of empathy towards the end-users of a product. This project has taught me the importance of iterating on design changes earlier in the process and that it's never too late to make a change if it advances the design, leading to a newfound understanding of UX research. My background in Landscape Architecture proved to be advantageous, allowing me to sketch out my thoughts and ideas seamlessly. Moving forward, I aim to focus more on empathizing with interviewees to better understand their needs and preferences.</p>
