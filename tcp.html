          <div><h3>Problem</h3>
          <p><strong>The Connected Parent is a newly launched site that requires refinement to many of 
            its primary features and overall design.</strong> While there has been a lot of 
            effort put into ensuring that the back-end of the platform is market ready, there 
            were concerns regarding the usability of the front-end of the site.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Specifically, users expressed confusion with several primary features</strong> including 
            how to create an account, navigate the search functionality, and write reviews 
            for businesses.
            <br><br>
            There was also concern about the color palette being used because the <strong>platform 
            did not meet accessibility guidelines.</strong> The client expressed that they were open to 
            adjusting color selections, but wanted to maintain a playful and inviting style.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>I updated The Connected Parent's website to meet the following goals:</p>
           <ul>
            <li><strong>Redesign the search function</strong> and filters to hold a more prominent position on the platform, and 
                provide a more versatile interface for the search filters so they can be easily adapted as the needs of 
                the users change.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Develop a style guide</strong> updated with new color options that meet accessibility guidelines and remain 
                closely aligned with the brand's original positioning.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Optimize workflows to make website navigation easy and intuitive for users,</strong> considering the placement 
                and functionality of menus and navigation bars, the ease of access to important pages, and the simplicity 
                of the overall design.</li>
            </ul>

        <div><h3>User Stories</h3>
        <p>To gain deeper insights into potential user challenges, I crafted user stories.

        <div><h3>Sketching</h3>
            <p>Understanding the needs and pain points of users was crucial in shaping the design direction. I explored a range of early ideas through quick sketches to rapidly iterate and visualize potential solutions. This allowed me to efficiently discuss directions with the client and ensure that the evolving vision aligned with their goals. These low-fidelity sketches also helped validate that new user flows would integrate well with the existing content and accommodate real user scenarios.</p>

      <!-- REFLECTION -->
      <div id="reflection" class="text-section-container">
      <div class="text-section-title">Conclusion</div>
      <p>Designing this app held a deep personal significance for me because my brother-in-law has a disability in which he requires comprehensive 
        support in his daily life. Because of this, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and obstacles involved in accessing disability resources, 
        particularly for adults. This drove my passion to assist the client in enhancing their existing website to better serve users.
        <br><br> 
        Embarking on this project, I found great excitement in my client's enthusiastic approach. It became clear to me that prioritizing the user's needs 
        and ensuring the brand's identity aligned with its function were of utmost importance. Throughout the process, there were numerous obstacles, 
        such as determining the right colors for the brand, which required multiple discussions with the client. However, the end result is a design that 
        is inclusive and user-friendly, and it fills me with pride.
        <br>    <br>        
        Looking ahead, the design has the potential to expand as additional features, including a social platform, are incorporated into the website. 
        I am eager to further refine and develop these ideas, building upon the foundation we have laid
        he final design of The Connected Parent platform offers an enhanced user experience, improved accessibility, and a refined visual identity. 
        This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design principles in creating impactful digital solutions.</p>
