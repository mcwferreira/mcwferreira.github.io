      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p class="p2">With the goal of crafting an immersive and user-centric study abroad ecosystem, Uspire aims to create seamless digital experiences for students pursuing their academic goals worldwide.</p>
    
      <div class="text-columns">
        <div>
          <h3>Problems</h3>
          <p class="p3">Many students face challenges when seeking advisors who can provide tailored guidance for their unique circumstances while preparing for standardized exams.</p>
          <P>Additionally, students frequently encounter difficulties in locating advisors who can offer specialized support based on their individual needs. This often results in a lack of personalized guidance crucial for their exam preparation.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p class="p3">The team envisioned this product as a comprehensive platform where counselors and advisors can efficiently oversee and guide their students on personalized journeys to success. The team worked together to design the account creation, login, storefront, dashboard, and client request/ offer screens to provide a transparent environment for managing resources and assessing each student's unique strengths and weaknesses.</p>
          <p>This resulted in a powerful tool that empowers counselors to effectively support and mentor their students, leading them toward academic achievement and fulfilling their dreams.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <p class="p2">With the scope outlined by the client and a clear set of goals, we worked to craft user stories for the site that focused on the key points that our client wanted our designs to encompass.</p>
      <p>As a user (counselor), I want to be able to create an account and log in.</p>
      <p>As a user, (counselor), I want to be able to showcase my services/plans, reviews, and testimonials.</p>

      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p class="p2">We focused on simplifying navigation, creating a reusable component system, and ensuring colors and typography met accessibility standards while staying true to TCP's brand personality. A large constraint in this phase, as well as through a lot of the design implementation, was the restricted search feature that required users to select keywords instead of typing them in. This impeded user experience and would later be rectified in later developments.</p>

The scope of the task involved ensuring that the new colors not only addressed accessibility concerns but also seamlessly integrated across their entire range of materials. Through this collaborative process, the client and I worked together to refine the palette and found an outcome that exceeded the client's expectations.</p>

  <!-- Reflection -->
  <section class="section-container" id="reflection">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p class="p2">Designing this app held a deep personal significance for me because my brother-in-law has a disability in which he requires comprehensive 
        support in his daily life. Because of this, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and obstacles involved in accessing disability resources, 
        particularly for adults. This drove my passion to assist the client in enhancing their existing website to better serve users.
        <br><br> 
        Embarking on this project, I found great excitement in my client's enthusiastic approach. It became clear to me that prioritizing the user's needs 
        and ensuring the brand's identity aligned with its function were of utmost importance. Throughout the process, there were numerous obstacles, 
        such as determining the right colors for the brand, which required multiple discussions with the client. However, the end result is a design that 
        is inclusive and user-friendly, and it fills me with pride.
        <br>    <br>        
        Looking ahead, the design has the potential to expand as additional features, including a social platform, are incorporated into the website. 
        I am eager to further refine and develop these ideas, building upon the foundation we have laid
        he final design of The Connected Parent platform offers an enhanced user experience, improved accessibility, and a refined visual identity. 
        This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design principles in creating impactful digital solutions.</p>
