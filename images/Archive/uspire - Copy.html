        <div><h3>Project Kick-off</h3>
          <p>At the outset, our team convened for a kickoff call to familiarize ourselves with the Uspire project's scope. During this session, we carefully reviewed the materials provided by the client, which encompassed resources such as a video showcasing the Uspire desktop app, a style guide, and a list of similar platforms. This opportunity also allowed us to formulate additional inquiries for the client, aiming to gain deeper insights into Uspire, its features, objectives, and design inspirations. This first step played a pivotal role in helping us identify the forthcoming challenges and tailor our design process to align with the specific needs and objectives of the Uspire project.

          <br>
          2. As a user, (counselor), I want to be able to showcase my services/plans, reviews, and testimonials.
          <br>
          3. As a user, (counselor), I want to be able to accept requests from a student and schedule initial intro calls.
          <br>
          4. As a user (counselor), I want to be able to send offers to the client (student)

        <div><h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>Having solidified our user stories, we proceeded to craft user flows as a strategic pathway for users to achieve their objectives. These user flows served as a visual guide, illustrating the steps users need to take while accommodating various choices they may encounter along the journey. I was tasked with completing user story 4 for this phase of the project.</p>

          <p>To begin the ideation process, we split up into teams and worked on expanding the user stories and developing wireframes.
            <br><br>
            I started creating medium-fidelity wireframes for sending an offer to a potential client. For this, I ensured that my wireframes facilitated a clearer understanding of the user journey and interactions.

            <br><br>
            Throughout this research journey, the team gleaned valuable insights into the components and styles employed by these competitors. These insights, in turn, played a pivotal role in shaping these crucial elements of the final design, ensuring that our approach aligned seamlessly with the client's desired aesthetics and best practices for user experience.

          <p>After gaining inspiration and a clear vision for our design, we prioritized the dashboard screen as the initial focus for our high-fidelity design efforts. Each team member crafted separate iterations of this screen, exploring various color schemes and layouts.
            <br><br>
            We presented three final design options to the client, with the middle option being the selected choice. This iteration demonstrated simplicity, conciseness, and a perfect alignment with the client's vision.

          <p>It was a quick transition from mid-fis to hi-fis with the completed style guide, component library, and approved UI iteration from the client. I worked again on user flow 4: As a user (counselor), I want to be able to send offers to the client (student).

          The output goals for the hi-fi designs were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="colo-smoke">Enhanced Clarity: I refined the screens from med-fi to ensure a crystal-clear process for counselors to send offers to students, eliminating any potential ambiguity or confusion.</li>
            <li class="colo-smoke">Streamlined Navigation: I optimized the navigation within the flow, reducing the number of steps required to complete the task, and making it more efficient and user-friendly.</li>
            <li class="colo-smoke">Improved Information Hierarchy: I fine-tuned the layout to emphasize key information, ensuring that essential details were prominently displayed, making it easy for both counselors and students to grasp the offer's significance.</li>
            <li class="colo-smoke">Established Color Palette: I harmonized with our updated colors, ensuring that the screens remained minimal yet visually appealing, creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing experience throughout the offer-sending process.</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- REFLECTION -->
      <div id="reflection" class="text-section-container">
      <div class="text-section-title">Reflection</div>
        <p>After working on Uspire, I had a valuable experience that emphasized the significance of collective effort and interdisciplinary collaboration. Engaging actively with stakeholders, project managers, and team members throughout the design process illuminated the remarkable impact of integrating diverse perspectives and shared insights.
        <br>
        Gaining insight into optimizing the counselor dashboard for enhanced time management and organization was a valuable experience. It was particularly fulfilling to work on edtech that has the potential to benefit students in the future. I also appreciated the opportunity to design a fluid, concise, and clear networking component for the project.
        <br>
        Our collaborative endeavors were characterized by vibrant brainstorming sessions, comprehensive design reviews, and open lines of communication. These practices not only enriched our approach to problem-solving but also resulted in innovative solutions. This experience underscored the essential importance of nurturing a collaborative work atmosphere, breaking down departmental barriers, and harnessing the collective expertise of the team to craft seamless and highly effective user experiences.
